#  Angular Popover

This is a fork from the excellent [@material-extended/mde 3.03](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-extended/mde) project.   The only change is to allow the library to be installed with Angular 10+ without using the --force flag, whereas the current version of the base library currently only allows Angular 8 and 9.

The base library should always be used in preference to this if using Angular 8 or 9, and once the base library is updated to Angular 10+, this fork will be redundant.
